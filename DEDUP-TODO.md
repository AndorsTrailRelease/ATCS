# TODOs I still have before I can create a PR
## this is not a List of things i should do, but what HAS to be done. 

There are probably a lot of things that could be optimized, which will not be on this list
(which will probably also be done, they are just not important enough to track them)


- check, why for example the "Forever" button is active for not altered entities (ex.: NPC->hitEffect) if they have a condition already there
  - apparently that's always been like that... (or at least on the most recent main branch)
